# pathways-to-RiC

 Getting Started With Converting EAD Files Using the RICOCONVERTER 
 
 ## Preprocessing Files
 The converter can hiccup on namespaces and missing doctype/dtd declarations. To avoid this, run preprocess.xquery over your EAD directory. 
 
 (Make sure to change https://github.com/Linked-Archival-Data/pathways-to-RiC/blob/main/preprocessing_tools/preprocess.xquery#L13 to your input path.)
